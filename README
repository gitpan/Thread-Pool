README for Thread::Pool

Create a group of threads to perform similar jobs, without having to start
and stop a thread for each job.  It is intended to be used in situations
where the completion of similar jobs (e.g. fetching URL's or resolving
reverse DNS of IP-numbers) may take an indeterminate amount of time.
Using a pool of threads, these jobs can be executed more or less
simultaneously, causing the wallclock time of an application to be shortened.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0-RC3 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with any
version of Perl before 5.8.0-RC3 or without threads enabled.
