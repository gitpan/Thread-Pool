Add high water/ low water mark functionality for throttling jobs being
submitted.  So, if number of jobs is larger than high, job() will block until
number of jobs is lower than low.

Add Thread::Pool::LogResolve functionality.  Possibly add an IO-layer for
it.

Add examples.

Add automatic handling of adding/removing threads a la Apache.
